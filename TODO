* TODO Register with WoW interface sites
  - Curse (http://www.curse.com)
  - WoWInterface (http://www.wowinterface.com)
  - WowMatrix (http://www.wowmatrix.com)
* TODO Make an install script that works on Windows
  install.sh works only on Mac

  Once ansel is available on Curse, etc., users presumably won't need
  this functionality.  A Windows install script would be for those
  users who don't use Curse, etc., to install their addons.
