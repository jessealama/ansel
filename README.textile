h2. Introduction

Ansel aims to take World of Warcraft screenshots in a new direction:
it implements

* rapid-fire screenshots to record battles;
* geotagging.

In addition, we aim to establish a web site with which one can share
one's World of Warcraft screenshots.

h2. News

Ansel is currently under development; no releases have been made.

h2. Installation

World of Warcraft addons can be installed by creating a subdirectory,
Ansel, of the World of Warcraft Addons directory and putting the XML
and lua files into that new directory.  One then launches World of
Warcraft and proceeds.  Don't forget to set up keybindings for the
various Ansel functions!
